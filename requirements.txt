# Network Mapper Requirements
# This tool primarily uses Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies are strictly required for basic functionality

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features:
# python-nmap>=0.7.1  # For advanced nmap integration (alternative to subprocess)
# colorama>=0.4.4     # For colored terminal output
# tabulate>=0.9.0     # For better table formatting
# matplotlib>=3.5.0   # For network visualization (future enhancement)
# networkx>=2.8       # For network graph analysis (future enhancement)

# Development dependencies:
# pytest>=7.0.0       # For unit testing
# black>=22.0.0       # For code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0       # For code linting

# Note: The script works with Python 3.6+ and uses only standard library modules
# for maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies.
